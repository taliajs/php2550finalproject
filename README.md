## About 
This repository contains the code associated with our final project, which is focused on Salmonella vaccines for poultry. Our goal for this project is to identify strains/flocks/regions, etc. that should be prioritized for vaccination campaigns (e.g specific strains, certain flocks and/or certain regions). For instance, looking at where, when and how are outbreaks happening generally, and looking at Salmonella outbreaks that cause illness.
